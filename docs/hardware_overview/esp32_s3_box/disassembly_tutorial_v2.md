- You will observe the touch panel is connected to the main board by two FPC cables, 8 pin and 20 pin, respectively. Unlock the two FPC connectors to separate the main board and touch screen. The touch screen is glued to the top case, we don't recommend you to tear off the whole touch screen as you may damage the FPC cable and the glass cover of the touch screen.

- You will see a microphone sub-board attached to the bottom case. The mic sub-board is connected to the main board through a 6 pin FPC cable. Unscrew the two screws of the microphone sub-board and unlock one side of the 6 pin FPC cable to remove the sub-board completely. Behind the microphone sub-board are the dust cover of two microphones, we do not recommend that you take down them since they are glued to the top case.
